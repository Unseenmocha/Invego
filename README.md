# Team 12 Project

## Team Overview

## Innovative Idea

Invego (working title) is a stock market game where instead of investing in companies, users invest in other users. You make an account and input information about yourself including a profile picture, bio, links to an social media you want to share, etc. You also start with a base number of bittles (our virtual currency) and get a low number of bittles daily. Users can invest in shares of other users thus increasing the net bittle worth of those users who can then invest their newfound bittles in other users.

One purpose of our webapp is a proof of concept for an applicaiton where individuals may actually be able to make money. It also serves as a social media type application where users can have fun building personal stock.
