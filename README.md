## Innovative Idea

## Data
Four non-user data types include:
- Stock Portfolios
- Individual shares (prices)
- Game currency
- Messages

A portfolio is a grouping of stocks. Each person might have a portfolio, though this is generated by the app, not being user data.

A stock or share (here used interchangeably) is an amount invested in a user profile. These can be bought and sold for a price depending on supply and demand. Stocks are associated with players and each stock will be based off of a players likeness. 

The game currency is called 'bittle'. Bittle can be used to buy and sell stocks. Players will get a fixed amount of bittle per week, as well as bittle gained from selling their stock. 

Messages are a way for players to communicate with each other with text and negotiate what price to buy or sell stocks if a player does not want to buy for the asking price. Based off of the negotiated prices which happen with messages, the price will be updated as a function of what it has sold for in the past.
