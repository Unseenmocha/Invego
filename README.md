# Team 12 Project

## Team Overview

## Innovative Idea

Invego (working title) is a stock market game where instead of investing in companies, users invest in other users. You make an account and input information about yourself including a profile picture, bio, links to an social media you want to share, etc. You also start with a base number of bittles (our virtual currency) and get a low number of bittles daily. Users can invest in shares of other users thus increasing the net bittle worth of those users who can then invest their newfound bittles in other users.

One purpose of our webapp is a proof of concept for an application where individuals may actually be able to make money. It also serves as a social media type application where users can have fun building personal stocks.

## Data

## Functionality
Four functionalities of the website includes: 
1. User profiles: Users should be able to create a profile with a profile picture, bio, and links to their social media accounts. This will allow other users to learn more about themselves before deciding to invest in others. Also, they can make changes to their profiles if they wish to.
2. Search and Discovery: Users should be able to search for other users based on various criteria, such as their interests, skills, or investment history. The user can also comment on others' posts.
3. Buy/Sell: Users should be able to invest in other users using "Bittles", the virtual currency of the platform. The value of a user's shares is based on their net worth, which is calculated based on their total holdings of Bittles and the current market value of their investments. The users can also sell their shares in other users at any time
4. Direct messaging: Users should be able to send direct messages to each other within the platform, allowing them to communicate privately and exchange investment ideas or strategies through a chatbox.
